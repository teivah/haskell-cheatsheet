{----- Guards -----}
{------------------}
-- Guards: make a function to check if some property of the passed values is
-- true or false
guard x
  | x < 0 = "negative"
  | x == 0 = "zero"
  | otherwise = "positive"

-- We can use guards to implement a max function
max' a b
  | a < b = a
  | otherwise = b

{-----------------}
{----- Where -----}
{-----------------}
-- We can precompute a value with where
bmiTell weight height
  | bmi < skinny = "underweight"
  | bmi < normal = "good"
  | otherwise = "overweigth"
  where
    bmi = weight / height ^ 2
    skinny = 18
    normal = 25

-- Note: where is not only used with guards
whereEx = "hello " ++ foo
  where
    foo = "foo"

-- We can also use where bindings with pattern match
initials firstname lastname = [f] ++ ". " ++ [l] ++ "."
  where
    (f:_) = firstname
    (l:_) = lastname

-- Note: Equivalent to
initials2 (f:_) (l:_) = [f] ++ ". " ++ [l] ++ "."

-- A where can also be a function
whereFunc n = add n
  where
    add n = n + 1

-- Where with pattern matching
wherePattern ls = "The list is " ++ what ls
  where
    what [] = "empty."
    what [x] = "a singleton list."
    what xs = "a longer list."

wherePattern2 n = what n
  where
    what 0 = "zero"
    what 1 = "one"
    what v = "other"

{---------------}
{----- Let -----}
{---------------}
-- let is similar to where binding
-- Difference:
-- * Only let expressions are expressions, where bindings aren't
--   Note: if something is an expression, then it has a value
-- * Can't be used across guards
-- * let are defined before, where after
letEx n =
  let a = n + 1
      b = n + 2
   in a * b

-- Each function takes only one parameter, it works using currying.
-- A curried function is a function that instead of taking several

-- with that parameter, it returns a function that takes the next
-- parameter, and so on.
--
-- If we call a function with two few parameters, we get back a partially
-- applied function

-- Fold
-- Folds allow to reduce a data structure to a single value

-- When we right fold over [1,2,3], we're essentially doing this:
-- f 1 (f 2 (f 3 acc))
--
-- Main difference between left and right folds: right folds work on infinite

-- Note: The ++ function is much slower than :, so we usually use right folds
