{----- Functor -----}
{-------------------}
-- A functor is a type class that abstracts the concept of mapping a function
-- over elements
-- For example: list, Maybe, Either, IO, etc. are instances of the functor type
-- class
-- Shorter version: list, Maybe, Either, IO, etc. are functors
--
-- Note that f is not a concrete type but a type constructor that takes one
-- type parameter (e.g., Maybe Int is concrete but Maybe is a type
-- constructor)
class Functor' f where
  -- Takes a function that maps a `a` into a `b` and a `a` box, returns a `b`
  -- box
  -- ðŸš¨ Said differently: applies a function to the element inside the box
  -- fmap applies a function to the value while preserving its context
  --
  -- Two possible analogies for fmap:
  -- * A function that takes a function and a functor value and then applies
  --   that function over the functor value
  -- * A function that takes a function and lifts (see below) that function so
  --   it operates on functor values
  -- See `res/fmap.png`
  fmap' :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Map is just an fmap that works only with lists:
-- instance Functor [] where
--   fmap = map
-- Note: If we bind the result of an I/O action to a name, only to apply a
-- function to that and call something else, we should consider using fmap
fmapEx = fmap (++ ", World!") (Just "Hello")

{------------------------}
{----- Functor laws -----}
{------------------------}
-- Law 1: if we map the id function over a functor value, the functor value that
-- we get back should be the same as the original value
-- Formally: fmap id = id
law1Ex = fmap id (Just 3) -- Just 3

-- Law 2: composing two functions and then mapping the resulting function over a
-- functor should be the same as first mapping one function over the functor and
-- then mapping the other one
-- Formally: fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g
law2Ex = do
  let a = fmap ((+ 1) . (* 2)) [1, 2, 3]
  let b = fmap (+ 1) . fmap (* 2) $ [1, 2, 3]
  a == b -- True

{----- Function lifting -----}
{----------------------------}
-- Function lifting is the process of transforming a function that operates on
-- simple values into a function that operates on more complex structures like
-- functors
-- Regular function
addOne :: Int -> Int
addOne x = x + 1

-- Lifted functions using fmap
addOneF :: Functor f => f Int -> f Int
-- addOneF is a function that takes a functor over a number and returns a
-- functor over a number
addOneF = fmap (+ 1)

  -- Take a value of any type and return an applicative value with that value
  -- inside (analogy: inside of a box)
  pure :: a -> f a
  -- Some similarities with fmap:
  -- * fmap takes a function and a functor value and applies the function
  --   inside the functor value
  -- * <*> (reads as "applies") takes a functor value that has a function in it
  --   and another functor, and extracts that function from the first functor
  --   and then maps it over the second one
  -- See `res/<*>.png`

-- ZipList implementation of Applicative
-- If we don't need combinations but only applying the first function to the

{----- Monads -----}

-- An extension of applicative
-- Provide a solution to the following problem: how do we apply a function of
-- type `a -> m b` to a value of type `m a`
-- Monad examples: Maybe, list
--
-- Monad functions:
-- * (>>=), called bind:
--   (>>=) :: (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
--   Example:
--   (>>=) :: (Monad Either) => Just Int -> (Int -> Just String) -> Just String
--   Allows to preserve the context of the value to which the function applies
-- * return: wraps a value inside a Monad
-- * do: chain monadic expressions
-- * (<-): extract a value from a Monad
-- * (<=<), called fish
--   Used for function composition (similar to .)
--
-- Monad class:
--  class Monad m where
--    return :: a -> m a
--    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
--    (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b

-- do is another way to chain monadic values
--
-- Do expressions are written line by line; they may look as imperative code but
-- they're just sequential, as each value in each line relies on the result of
-- the previous ones, along with their contexts
--
-- Note: be it <- or let, the variable is assigned a non-monadic value
-- Yet, <- takes a monadic value
withDo :: Maybe String

-- The same using (>>=)

-- Monad laws
--
-- * First law: left identity
--   If we take a value, put it in a default context with return and then feed
--   it to a function using >>=, that's the same as just taking the value and
--   applying the function to it
--   return x >>= f   is equivalent to   f x
--
--   return 3 >>= (\x -> Just (x+100000))
--   (\x -> Just (x+100000)) 3
--   Just 100003
--
-- * Second law: right identity
--   If we have a monadic value and we use >>= to feed it to return, the result
--   is our original monadic value
--   m >>= return   is equivalent to   just m
--
-- * Third law: associativity
--   When we have a chain of monadic function applications with >>=, it
--   shouldnâ€™t matter how theyâ€™re nested
--   (m >>= f) >>= g   is equivalent to   m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)
